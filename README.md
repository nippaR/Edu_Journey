# Edu_Journey

--------------------

Edu Journey is an educational social platform designed to help students share their academic experiences, referred resources, and life guides. The platform enables users to create posts with descriptions, up to three images, and a 10-second video clip. Other users can view, like, share, and refer to the mentioned resources.
This system will be implemented using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, ensuring a scalable, secure, and user-friendly experience. Authentication will be JWT-based, and all sensitive user data will be securely stored.
Edu Journey provides a structured way for students to connect, learn from each other, and follow inspiring academic figures.
